			<h3>Flights</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>Are the prices shown on your site applicable to all?</dt>
				<dd> - Yes. However, INR prices are applicable to resident Indians. International fares are applicable to both the Indian residents and foreigners.</dd>
				<dt>Can I use travel vouchers, certificates or frequent flyer miles to purchase through the site?</dt>
				<dd> - Airlines generally require that tickets purchased using either frequent flier miles or travel vouchers be handled directly at one of their locations. The same is true for vouchers issued by a variety of travel clubs. You will need to contact them directly to purchase your ticket.</dd>
				<dt>How do I make a reservation for someone else?</dt>
				<dd> - To complete a reservation for someone else, simply type in his or her name instead of yours for the passenger/traveler name. Your profile information (e.g. name, address, phone number, etc.) will be used as a default. However, you may type over the appropriate fields and replace them with the actual traveler's information.</dd>
				<dt>How do I know my reservation is confirmed?</dt>
				<dd> - You will get the registeration status online before you book. After we receive your reservation, we will send you an immediate e-mail confirmation. This e-mail will include your itinerary details and ticket price. You may also confirm your reservation online by accessing "My Itinerary"section on the home page.</dd>
				<dt>I saw a lower airfare advertised today. Why can't I get that airfare using MakeMyTrip.com?</dt>
				<dd> - This may occur due to several reasons. Airlines generally restrict the number of seats that may be sold at a discounted fare. Those seats may have already been sold out by the time you accessed the system. Also, most discounted fares carry certain travel restrictions such as minimum/maximum stay requirements, advance purchase, blackout dates, etc. makemytrip.com takes these restrictions into account when pricing your itinerary. The advertisement should outline these restrictions. Airlines also keep changing the prices and we have no control on airline pricing as well.</dd>

			<h3>Credit Card Payment</h3>
			<dl>
				<dt>Is my credit card information secure?</dt>
				<dd> - We make every effort to keep all your personal information, including your credit card number, secure. Makemytrip.com uses the Secured Socket Layer (SSL) technology to allow your credit card number to be transimitted to us over the internet, if your browser supports this encryption.

				<dt>If I store a credit card number in my profile, will charges be automatically billed to my card?</dt>
				<dd> - No. We won't charge anything to your credit card until you make a purchase using it.</dd>
				<dt>I still don't feel comfortable transmitting my credit card information on the Internet. Are there alternatives for providing my credit card data to MakeMyTrip.com?</dt>
				<dd> - Yes. We'd be happy to enter your credit card number directly into your profile for you. Contact our Customer Service Department, through the Travel Wizzy and include your Login ID or Name, credit card type, credit card number and credit card expiry date. Also, please provide us with a phone number, in case we need to contact you.</dd>
