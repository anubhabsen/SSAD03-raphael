Raphael Coding Style
====================


Javascript Coding Style
-----------------------

* Use camelCase for identifier names (variables and functions).
* All names start with an alphabet.
* Use spaces around operators ( = + - * / % ), and after commas.
* Always use tabs for indentation and set tab width = 4 spaces.
* End simple statements with semicolons.
* Put opening curly braces at the end of the first line.
* Use one space before opening a bracket.
* Put the closing curly braces on a new line with no leading spaces.
* Place opening bracket on same line as object name.
* Use colon plus one space between each property and its value.
* End object definition with semicolon.
* Short objects CAN be compressed to one line, but it is recommended to display each property in a different line.
* If line size is greater than 80, attempt to break it.
